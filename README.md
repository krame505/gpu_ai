GPU-based Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm

## Setup info
This repository is expected to be cloned within the src directory in the NVIDIA GPU SDK.  

Due to the use of C++11 features, gcc 5+ must be used.  
On ECE GPU lab machines, this can be found in /opt/rh/devtoolset-4/root/usr/bin/, which should be added to your PATH so that the correct version is used by make.
